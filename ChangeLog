8-Mar-1998	File::PathConvert for perl5 version 0.4

		mkshadow
			- Bug (Mkshadow converted symbolic links into real path.)
			  fixed.
		abs2rel	- modified to produce regularize path name.


9-Jan-1998	File::PathConvert for perl5 version 0.3

		PathConvert.pm
			- fixed the statment of online manual.

		Following useful modifications were submitted by Jesse N. Glick.

		* using $VERSION, to placate CPAN, Exporter, MakeMaker, etc.
		* exporting package variables, all of which seem to be designed
		  for possible customization (or retrieval of info in the case
		  of $resolved)
		* prototyping public functions (those extra semicolons prevent
		  e.g. CPerl mode from thinking `$' escapes the following `)'
		  and messing up Emacs)
		* using standard indented format for literal program examples;
		  use of .br is nonstandard and will not work on anything but
		  nroff/troff (e.g. pod2html)
		* including suggested use of $resolved in SYNOPSIS
		* putting more useful information in the warning messages
