	(target directory)  (current directory)

rel2abs - make an absolute path from a relative path

	'../../src/bin' and '/usr/local/lib' -> '/usr/src/bin'
	(target directory)  (current directory)

4. History

17-Sep-1996	first RFC on comp.lang.perl.modules.
		Subject: RFC File::PathConvert module
		Message-ID: <51m90o$pos@newsgate.so-net.or.jp>

7-Oct-1996	second RFC on comp.lang.perl.modules.
		Subject: 2nd RFC File::PathConvert module
		Message-ID: <53a449$2qo@newsgate.so-net.or.jp>

		PathConvert.pm -
			use @EXPORT_OK instead of @EXPORT.
			realpath added.
			use $SL variable for path separator.

23-Oct-1996	version 0.1
			Tested with perl5.003_02.

9-Jan-1998	version 0.3

		PathConvert.pm
			- fixed the statment of online manual.

		Following useful modifications were submitted by Jesse N. Glick.

		* using $VERSION, to placate CPAN, Exporter, MakeMaker, etc.
		* exporting package variables, all of which seem to be designed
		  for possible customization (or retrieval of info in the case
		  of $resolved)
		* prototyping public functions (those extra semicolons prevent
		  e.g. CPerl mode from thinking `$' escapes the following `)'
		  and messing up Emacs)
		* using standard indented format for literal program examples;
		  use of .br is nonstandard and will not work on anything but
		  nroff/troff (e.g. pod2html)
		* including suggested use of $resolved in SYNOPSIS
		* putting more useful information in the warning messages

8-Mar-1998	version 0.4

		mkshadow
			- Bug (Mkshadow converted symbolic links into real path.)
			  fixed.
		abs2rel	- modified to produce regularize path name.
